                     Contract between hashcode and equals method
..........................................................................................
>you must override hashCode() in every class that overrides equals() method

>Failure to do so will result in a voilation of the general contract for Object.hashCode(), 
 which will prevent your class from functioning properly in conjunction with all hash-based 
 collections, including HashMap, HashSet and HashTable
